# QuoteGenerator
This Python program uses the amazing website inspirobot.me to generate nonsense quotes and save them on your device as png. You can specify any amount of quotes you want to download. Please note that you will need a chrome driver & python installed for this program to work, otherwise it won't work.

If you're getting any module errors, run setup.py and try again.
